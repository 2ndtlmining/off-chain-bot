# duckpools-off-chain-bot

## Overview
All orders submitted on the duckpools user interface require off-chain processing. 
Off-chain bots find pending orders and organize submissions to the blockchain to allow for wider concurrent usage of the protocol.
Anyone can run off-chain bots and the nature of user orders and interst_rate processing allow bots to award themselves a small fee from each order submitted.
Bots can be configured to run the full set of protocol pools, a subset of pools, or just liquidations.
